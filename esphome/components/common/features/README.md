This folder is for features that don't neatly fit into any of the other folders, usually because they combine a number of sensors, scripts and other components into a solution. An example of this is the FastUpdateMode.yml, which allows a component to add a feature that provides a dynamic update interval setting for components that occasionally need a much faster update interval, like tank fill valves.
